# Data-Analysis-using-Bayesian-Inference
Data Analysis Project using R

In this project,  a data set (from data.worldbank.org) which contains the population ages 65 and above as a percentage of the total population for 269 countries is analyzed. 
Ageing population ratio change globally between 2016 and 2017 is compared, and a model with a specific distribution of ageing population ratio for the USA is built as well. Since the model parameters are random variables, Bayesian inference is chosen as a feasible approach. Furthermore, in Bayesian statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been a key step in making it possible to compute large hierarchical models, and it is utilized here. Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is a specific implementation of MCMC, is performed to compute the distribution over the parameters over the parameters.
